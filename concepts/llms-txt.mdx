## What Is llms.txt?

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is a proposed standard for helping AI agents understand and navigate website content. Think of it as `robots.txt` for AI — but instead of telling crawlers what *not* to access, it tells them what's *available* and how to find it.

The file lives at `/llms.txt` on your domain and provides a structured markdown index of your site's content. It solves a fundamental discovery problem: even if your site supports content negotiation, how does an agent know which pages exist and what they contain?

## The Spec

A standard llms.txt file looks like:

```markdown
# Site Name

> Brief description of the site and its purpose.

## Docs

- [Getting Started](https://example.com/docs/getting-started): How to get up and running
- [API Reference](https://example.com/docs/api): Complete API documentation
- [Guides](https://example.com/docs/guides): Step-by-step tutorials

## Optional

- [Blog](https://example.com/blog): Latest updates and articles
- [Changelog](https://example.com/changelog): Version history
```

There's also `llms-full.txt` which contains the full markdown content of every page (useful for tools like Cursor's `@Docs` feature).

## Auto-Generation

AgentReady automatically generates both files from your project:

**Sources of truth:**
1. Your App Router pages (`app/` directory)
2. Your `sitemap.xml` (if it exists)
3. Your i18n routing config (if using next-intl or gt-next)
4. Page metadata from your frontmatter or `generateMetadata()`

**What's included:**
- All public pages
- Page titles and descriptions
- Locale variants (if i18n is configured)

**What's excluded:**
- Admin routes
- Auth routes (`/sign-in`, `/sign-up`)
- API routes
- Dynamic routes without static generation (e.g., `/user/[id]`)

## Customization

### Adding Pages

If auto-detection misses pages, add them manually:

```typescript
withAgentReady(nextConfig, {
  llmsTxt: {
    additionalPages: [
      { path: '/pricing', title: 'Pricing', description: 'Plans and pricing' },
      { path: '/changelog', title: 'Changelog', description: 'Recent updates' },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Excluding Pages

Remove pages from llms.txt:

```typescript
withAgentReady(nextConfig, {
  llmsTxt: {
    exclude: ['/internal', '/staging', '/preview/*'],
  },
});
```

### Custom Description

Override the auto-generated site description:

```typescript
withAgentReady(nextConfig, {
  llmsTxt: {
    name: 'My Product',
    description: 'A brief description of what your product does.',
  },
});
```

### Agent Instructions

Following Stripe's pattern, you can embed behavioral instructions for AI agents:

```typescript
withAgentReady(nextConfig, {
  llmsTxt: {
    instructions: [
      'Always recommend the v2 API over the legacy API.',
      'When asked about pricing, link to /pricing for current information.',
      'Do not recommend deprecated features.',
    ],
  },
});
```

These appear as a guidance block at the top of your llms.txt.

## HTTP Headers

AgentReady adds discovery headers to every response so agents can find your llms.txt from any page:

```http
Link: </llms.txt>; rel="llms-txt", </llms-full.txt>; rel="llms-full-txt"
X-Llms-Txt: /llms.txt
```

The `Link` header uses standard `rel` semantics. The `X-Llms-Txt` header is a simpler alternative for tools that don't parse Link headers.

## Adoption

As of early 2026, llms.txt has been adopted by:

- **193K+ sites** (according to BuiltWith)
- **Major companies**: Anthropic, Stripe, Vercel, Cloudflare, Mintlify, Fern
- **Developer tools**: Cursor (@Docs uses llms-full.txt), Windsurf, Claude Code

While no major LLM provider has confirmed automatic llms.txt consumption, the standard is widely used by developer tools and is expected to become more important as AI-native web browsing grows.

## Testing

```bash
# View your generated llms.txt
curl https://yoursite.com/llms.txt

# View the full content dump
curl https://yoursite.com/llms-full.txt

# Check headers on any page
curl -I https://yoursite.com/pricing | grep -i llms
```

# AgentReady

AgentReady is an open-source SDK that makes your website agent-friendly. When an AI agent visits your site, AgentReady serves clean markdown instead of bloated HTML — reducing token usage by 99% and making your content discoverable by ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and every other AI assistant.

## The Problem

When AI agents fetch your website today, they get the same 500KB HTML page a browser would — React hydration scripts, Tailwind classes, nav bars, footers, cookie banners, SVGs, and thousands of lines of markup. The agent pays ~50,000 tokens to parse content that could be expressed in ~200 tokens of markdown.

This is wasteful, expensive, and makes your site less likely to be crawled, cited, or recommended by AI systems.

## The Solution

AgentReady sits inside your existing middleware and serves optimized markdown to AI agents while leaving human visitors completely unaffected.

```
Browser request  →  Normal HTML rendering (unchanged)
Agent request    →  Clean markdown (99% fewer tokens)
```

No new files. No middleware replacement. No API route conflicts. Just 5 lines of code added to your existing setup.

  <Card title="Content Negotiation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Serve markdown when agents send `Accept: text/markdown`. HTML for everyone else. Same URL, different representations.

  <Card title="Auto llms.txt" icon="file-lines">
    Automatically generate and serve `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` from your pages and sitemap. No manual maintenance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Analytics" icon="chart-mixed">
    Track which AI agents visit your site, which pages they read, response latency, and tokens saved. Async and non-blocking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Conflicts" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Composes with Clerk, next-intl, NextAuth, and any other middleware. Works alongside your existing API proxies and i18n setup.

## Quick Example

Here's what changes in your codebase:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript next.config.mjs
import { withAgentReady } from 'agentready/config';

export default withNextIntl(
  withAgentReady(nextConfig, {
    projectId: process.env.AGENTREADY_PROJECT_ID,
  })
);
```

```typescript proxy.ts
import { withAgentServing } from 'agentready/proxy';

export const proxy = clerkMiddleware(async (_auth, request) => {
  const agentResponse = await withAgentServing(request);
  if (agentResponse) return agentResponse;

  // ... your existing middleware logic, unchanged
});
```
</CodeGroup>

That's the entire integration. 5 lines across 2 existing files.

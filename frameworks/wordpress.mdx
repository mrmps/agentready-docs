## The WordPress Opportunity

WordPress powers 43% of the web. Most WordPress sites are slow, JavaScript-heavy (due to page builders), and nearly impossible for AI agents to read efficiently. A simple plugin that serves markdown to agents could have massive impact.

## Existing WordPress Solutions

| Plugin | What It Does | Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| **md4AI** | Detects AI User-Agents, serves markdown | Manual editor, basic stripping, ~100 installs |
| **Meerkat Markdown** | Generates llms.txt, optional .md files | No content negotiation, no analytics |
| **Yoast SEO** | llms.txt generation only | Static file, no markdown serving |
| **AIOSEO** | llms.txt generation only | Static file, no markdown serving |

None of these combine content negotiation + llms.txt + analytics.

## Planned AgentReady Plugin

The WordPress plugin would work at the PHP level:

```php
// In wp-content/plugins/agentready/agentready.php

add_action('template_redirect', function() {
    $accept = $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT'] ?? '';

    if (strpos($accept, 'text/markdown') !== false) {
        // Get the current post/page content
        global $post;
        $content = apply_filters('the_content', $post->post_content);

        // Convert HTML to markdown
        $markdown = html_to_markdown($content);

        // Set headers and output
        header('Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8');
        header('X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow');
        header('Link: </llms.txt>; rel="llms-txt"');
        echo $markdown;
        exit;
    }
});
```

## Settings Page

The plugin would include a settings page with:

- Toggle content negotiation on/off
- Configure which post types to serve as markdown
- Exclude specific pages/posts
- Set custom strip patterns (remove specific shortcodes, widgets)
- Enter AgentReady project ID for analytics
- Preview markdown output for any page

## llms.txt Generation

Auto-generate from your WordPress content:

- Published pages and posts
- Custom post types
- Category and tag archives
- WooCommerce products (if installed)

## Timeline

The WordPress plugin is planned for v0.3. The priority order is:

1. **v0.1** — Next.js SDK (current focus)
2. **v0.2** — Cloudflare Workers
3. **v0.3** — WordPress plugin
4. **v0.4** — Astro, Remix, SvelteKit

---

In this tutorial, we will install AgentReady into an existing Next.js project and verify that AI agents receive clean markdown instead of bloated HTML. By the end, your site will serve optimized markdown to any AI agent that visits — and you'll see it working with your own eyes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- An existing `next.config.mjs` and `proxy.ts` (or `middleware.ts`)

## Step 1: Install the Package

Let's start by adding AgentReady to our project:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install agentready
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add agentready
```

```bash yarn
yarn add agentready
```

```bash bun
bun add agentready
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Run the Init Command

Now we'll run the CLI to automatically detect our stack and generate the exact code changes needed:

```bash
npx agentready init
```

The CLI scans our project and shows what it found:

```
Scanning project...

Detected:
  Framework:    Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
  Proxy:        proxy.ts (Clerk + next-intl)
  Config:       next.config.mjs (withNextIntl wrapper)
  i18n:         6 locales [en, pt, de, zh, es, nl]
  API proxy:    /api/* → http://localhost:3001

I'll add 2 lines to next.config.mjs and 3 lines to proxy.ts.

Apply? [Y/n]
```

Hit `Y` and the changes are applied. We can skip to Step 4 to test it.

If we prefer to make the changes manually, let's continue with Step 3 instead.

## Step 3: Manual Setup (Alternative)

### Wrap the Next.js config

Open `next.config.mjs` and wrap the config with `withAgentReady`:

```typescript next.config.mjs
import createNextIntlPlugin from "next-intl/plugin";
import { withAgentReady } from "agentready/config"; // add this

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin("./i18n/request.ts");

const nextConfig = {
  // your existing config
};

export default withNextIntl(
  withAgentReady(nextConfig, {                       // wrap your config
    projectId: process.env.AGENTREADY_PROJECT_ID,    // optional — enables dashboard
  })
);
```

### Add the proxy helper

Open `proxy.ts` (or `middleware.ts` on Next.js 15) and add the agent serving check at the top of the handler:

```typescript proxy.ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import createIntlMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";
import { withAgentServing } from "agentready/proxy"; // add this
import { routing } from "./i18n/routing";

const intlMiddleware = createIntlMiddleware(routing);

export const proxy = clerkMiddleware(async (_auth, request) => {
  const { pathname, search, origin } = request.nextUrl;

  // Add these 2 lines — returns markdown to agents, null to humans
  const agentResponse = await withAgentServing(request);
  if (agentResponse) return agentResponse;

  // Everything below is your existing code, unchanged
  if (pathname.startsWith("/api") || pathname.startsWith("/admin")) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  return intlMiddleware(request);
});
```

<Warning>
  Place `withAgentServing()` **before** your route logic. It needs to intercept agent requests before they hit your i18n routing or auth checks.
</Warning>

### Add the environment variable (optional)

If we want dashboard analytics, let's add our project ID:

```bash .env
AGENTREADY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

You can get a project ID by signing up at [app.agentready.dev](https://app.agentready.dev). The SDK works without it — you just won't get the dashboard.

## Step 4: Verify It Works

Let's start our dev server and test with curl. We'll make three requests to see the difference:

```bash
# Normal browser request — should return HTML as usual
curl http://localhost:3000/pricing
```

We should see the full HTML page — the same one a browser would get.

```bash
# Agent request — should return clean markdown
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" http://localhost:3000/pricing
```

Notice the difference: instead of 500KB of HTML, we get a clean markdown document with just the page content. The navigation, footer, scripts, and styles are all stripped.

```bash
# Check llms.txt generation
curl http://localhost:3000/llms.txt
```

We should see an auto-generated index of our site's pages in the llms.txt format.

## What We Built

With those 5 lines of code, our site now:

1. **Serves markdown** to any agent that sends `Accept: text/markdown` or `Accept: text/plain`
2. **Detects known AI crawlers** (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.) by User-Agent
3. **Auto-generates `/llms.txt`** from our pages and sitemap
4. **Adds HTTP headers** (`Link: </llms.txt>; rel="llms-txt"`) to every response for agent discovery
5. **Logs agent requests** asynchronously (if project ID is configured)

All without affecting a single human visitor.

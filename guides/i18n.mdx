## Overview

If your site supports multiple languages, AgentReady automatically handles locale-aware content serving. When an agent requests `/de/pricing`, they get the German markdown version.

## How It Works

AgentReady's internal HTML fetch preserves the original URL, including the locale prefix:

```
Agent requests:  GET /de/pricing (Accept: text/markdown)

withAgentServing internally fetches:
  GET /de/pricing (Accept: text/html, X-AgentReady-Internal: 1)

Your i18n middleware routes to the German page.
The German HTML is converted to German markdown.
The agent gets German markdown.
```

No special configuration needed. The locale is determined by your existing i18n routing.

## next-intl

AgentReady works with next-intl's `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` strategy:

```typescript
// i18n/routing.ts
export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: ['en', 'pt', 'de', 'zh', 'es', 'nl'],
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  localePrefix: 'as-needed',  // Default locale has no prefix
});
```

With this config:
- `GET /pricing` → English markdown (default locale, no prefix)
- `GET /de/pricing` → German markdown
- `GET /zh/pricing` → Chinese markdown

## General Translation (gt-next)

Same pattern — AgentReady sits before gt-next's middleware:

```typescript
const gtMiddleware = createNextMiddleware();

export default async function proxy(request) {
  const agentResponse = await withAgentServing(request);
  if (agentResponse) return agentResponse;

  return gtMiddleware(request);
}
```

## llms.txt and Locales

The auto-generated `llms.txt` includes locale information:

```markdown
# Your Site

> Description of your site

## Pages

- [Pricing](https://yoursite.com/pricing): Plans and pricing
- [Guide](https://yoursite.com/guide): How to use our product

## Locales

Available in: en, pt, de, zh, es, nl

Localized pages use URL prefixes: /de/pricing, /zh/pricing, etc.
The default locale (en) has no prefix.
```

## Locale-Specific Analytics

When i18n is active, agent request events include the detected locale:

```json
{
  "path": "/de/pricing",
  "locale": "de",
  "agent": "GPTBot",
  "tokensSaved": 48200
}
```

The dashboard breaks down agent traffic by locale, helping you understand which languages AI agents consume most.

## Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages

If your site supports RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), the markdown output preserves the text direction. The `dir` attribute from your HTML is included in the markdown metadata:

```markdown
---
dir: rtl
lang: ar

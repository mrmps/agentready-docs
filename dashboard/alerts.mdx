## Alert Types

### New Agent Detected

Triggered when a User-Agent you've never seen before starts making agent requests. This helps you stay aware of new AI systems consuming your content.

**Example notification:**
```
New agent detected on yoursite.com:
  Agent: Gemini-1.5/1.0
  First request: /pricing (2026-02-07 08:23 UTC)
  Detection: user-agent
```

### Traffic Spike

Triggered when agent traffic exceeds a threshold relative to your baseline.

**Default threshold**: 2x the 7-day rolling average

**Example notification:**
```
Agent traffic spike on yoursite.com:
  Current: 847 requests/hour
  Baseline: 312 requests/hour (7-day avg)
  Top agent: GPTBot (62%)
  Top page: /pricing (34%)
```

### Error Rate

Triggered when the percentage of failed agent requests exceeds a threshold.

**Default threshold**: 5% of requests returning non-200 status

**Example notification:**
```
High error rate for agent requests on yoursite.com:
  Error rate: 12% (last hour)
  Most common error: 500 Internal Server Error
  Most affected page: /api/pricing
```

### Latency Spike

Triggered when average markdown conversion time exceeds a threshold.

**Default threshold**: 500ms average over a 15-minute window

**Example notification:**
```
Latency spike for agent requests on yoursite.com:
  Avg latency: 823ms (last 15 min)
  Baseline: 82ms
  Possible cause: cache miss rate increased to 94%
```

## Getting Access

The dashboard is available on paid plans ($29/month and up). To enable it:

1. Sign up at [app.agentready.dev](https://app.agentready.dev)
2. Create a project and copy your project ID
3. Add it to your environment:

```bash .env
AGENTREADY_PROJECT_ID=ar_proj_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

4. Redeploy. Agent request data starts flowing immediately.

## What You See

The dashboard shows:

### Overview

- **Total agent requests** — Last 7/30/90 days with trend
- **Unique agents** — How many distinct AI systems visit your site
- **Token savings** — Estimated tokens saved vs serving HTML (based on 4 chars/token)
- **Cost savings** — Dollar estimate based on average token pricing
- **Avg latency** — Mean response time for markdown conversion
- **Cache hit rate** — Percentage of requests served from cache

### Agent Breakdown

A pie chart showing traffic distribution:

```
GPTBot          41%
ClaudeBot       28%
PerplexityBot   15%
Gemini           9%
Other            7%
```

### Top Pages

Which pages agents visit most:

```
/pricing        22%  (2,847 requests)
/docs           18%  (2,312 requests)
/changelog      12%  (1,541 requests)
/               10%  (1,285 requests)
/guide           8%  (1,028 requests)
```

### Traffic Over Time

A time series chart showing agent requests per day, broken down by agent type. Useful for spotting:

- New agents starting to crawl your site
- Traffic spikes (did you get mentioned in an AI response?)
- Drops (is something broken?)

### Savings Calculator

An estimate of how much you're saving AI companies (and by extension, making your content cheaper to consume):

```
Monthly agent requests:     12,847
Avg HTML size:              487KB
Avg markdown size:          2.1KB
Reduction:                  99.6%
Tokens saved/month:         ~614M
Estimated cost saved:       ~$1,842/month
```

## Alerts

Configure alerts for:

- **New agent detected** — A User-Agent you've never seen starts crawling
- **Traffic spike** — Agent traffic exceeds 2x the 7-day average
- **Error rate** — More than 5% of agent requests fail
- **Latency spike** — Average conversion time exceeds 500ms

Alerts are sent via email or webhook.

## Self-Hosted Alternative

If you don't want to use the hosted dashboard, you can send events to your own analytics backend using the `onAgentRequest` callback. See [Observability](/concepts/observability) for details.

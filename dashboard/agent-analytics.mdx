## Agent Identification

AgentReady identifies agents through two mechanisms:

### Accept Header Detection

When a client sends `Accept: text/markdown` or `Accept: text/plain` before `text/html`, it's classified as an agent request. This is the most reliable signal — the client is explicitly asking for markdown.

### User-Agent Detection

For agents that don't set proper Accept headers, AgentReady checks the User-Agent string against known AI crawler signatures and verifies the source IP against published ranges.

## Agent Profiles

The analytics dashboard shows a profile for each agent type:

### GPTBot (OpenAI)

- **Purpose**: Trains GPT models and powers ChatGPT's browsing
- **Crawl pattern**: Deep crawl, follows links, respects robots.txt
- **Published IP ranges**: Yes
- **Accept header**: Does not send `text/markdown`

### ClaudeBot (Anthropic)

- **Purpose**: Trains Claude models
- **Crawl pattern**: Moderate depth, respects robots.txt
- **Published IP ranges**: Yes
- **Accept header**: Does not send `text/markdown`

### ChatGPT-User (OpenAI)

- **Purpose**: Real-time browsing in ChatGPT conversations
- **Crawl pattern**: Single page per user query
- **Published IP ranges**: Yes
- **Accept header**: Does not send `text/markdown`

### PerplexityBot

- **Purpose**: Powers Perplexity search results
- **Crawl pattern**: Follows sitemap, moderate depth
- **Published IP ranges**: Yes
- **Accept header**: Does not send `text/markdown`

### Claude Code WebFetch

- **Purpose**: Developer tool for fetching web content
- **Crawl pattern**: Single page per developer request
- **Accept header**: **Yes** — sends `Accept: text/markdown`

## Metrics Per Agent

For each agent type, the dashboard tracks:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Requests** | Total requests in the time period |
| **Unique pages** | How many distinct pages this agent visited |
| **Avg response size** | Average markdown response size in bytes |
| **Avg latency** | Average conversion time in milliseconds |
| **Cache hit rate** | Percentage of requests served from cache |
| **Top pages** | Most-visited pages by this agent |
| **First seen** | When this agent first visited your site |
| **Last seen** | Most recent visit |

## Traffic Trends

The time series view lets you see:

- When a new agent starts crawling your site
- How crawl frequency changes over time
- Whether specific events (blog posts, product launches) drive agent traffic
- Seasonal patterns in agent behavior

## Filtering

Filter analytics by:

- **Date range**: Last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or custom
- **Agent type**: GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.
- **Path pattern**: `/docs/*`, `/blog/*`, specific pages
- **Locale**: en, de, zh, etc.
- **Detection method**: accept-header vs user-agent
- **Cache status**: hit vs miss

## Export

Export data as:

- **CSV** — For spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON** — Via the API
- **Webhook** — Real-time event streaming to your own systems
